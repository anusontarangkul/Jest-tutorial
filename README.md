# Jest Crash Course - Unit Testing in JavaScript

## Description

This is the code along for following the [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7r4xVDI2vho) tutorial by Traversy Media on Jest.

I learned how to setup Jest and the syntax used to run tests. I learned about different matchers, how to test async code (using axios), run functions before and after different tests, and how to continously run tets.
